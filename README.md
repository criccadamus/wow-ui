Wago fucked me up and lost half of my backups. Fuck you Wago.

## Notes

### San Francisco font usage

Apple's `San Francisco` font license does [not permit personal usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(sans-serif_typeface)).  
This is important since some of the WeakAuras use it but is not provided here.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You can import any profile or WeakAura without "installing" the font. It will work fine, but missing fonts will default to `Friz Quadrata TT`.  

>[!NOTE]
> You may download the font elsewhere, change the file name to be the same as [the edited file](/elvui/SharedMediaEdit.md) (or edit the name yourself) and it will work fine as it is.

>[!TIP]
>You may install the fonts in a past date. ElvUI will then load them and fill any missing or default fonts.
